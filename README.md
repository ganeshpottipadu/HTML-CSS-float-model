# HTML-CSS-float-model
This HTML code creates a page with two floated `&lt;div>` elements: one for "CatCSS" floated left and the other for "DogCSS" floated right. Both contain an image and text. The `div` elements are styled with `float`, background color, and 40% width. The footer text appears below. Text wraps around floated elements.
